## Inspiration
We drew on our experiences of trying—and failing—to keep a dorm plant alive and sought to make life better for our leafy friends while helping people improve their mental health by growing plants.

## What it does
Put in your personal circumstances to get recommendations on houseplants to get. Then, keep motivated through a points and levels system that rewards healthy plant care. Finally, see how plant owners around you are doing and connect with them. Tap into the benefits of growing plants!

## How we built it
We used the Gemini API to take in user preferences and output well-matching house plants. We used Supabase to keep track of user and plant data, Express.js for backend development, and React for frontend development.

## Challenges we ran into
Incorporating OAuth with Supabase did not work out. We also had to become more familiar with React and Supabase, and figure out how to interface with Gemini for this project. 

## Accomplishments that we're proud of
Getting Gemini to output in a format that we could format and display nicely on the website. 

## What we learned
React, LLM prompting, databases, authorization

## What's next for FernFriends
Incorporating more opportunities to earn points and adding a friends feature that allows you to better keep track of their progress.
